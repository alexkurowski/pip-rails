# IMPORTANT NOTES

For geolocation to work properly the app should be accessed via https connection, so if you're going to run it locally, make sure you can access it with `https://` protocol. You can use a tunnelling tool such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for that.

And don't forget to allow location service in your browser.
